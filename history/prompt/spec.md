/sp.specify In-Memory Python Console-Based Todo Application (Phase I)

Target audience:
- Beginner to intermediate Python developers

Objective:
- Build a clean, reliable, command-line todo application that stores all tasks in memory

Scope & Focus:
- Core CRUD-style todo management via console
- Emphasis on clean code, clarity, and correctness
- Foundation for future phases (DB, API, AI)

Success criteria:
- Implements all 5 basic features:
  1. Add todo
  2. View todos
  3. Update todo
  4. Delete todo
  5. Mark todo as complete
- Application runs without errors on Python 3.13+
- Clear, user-friendly CLI flow
- Code is modular, readable, and logically structured

Constraints:
- In-memory storage only (lists/dictionaries)
- Console-based interaction only (no GUI, no web)
- No file I/O, no databases, no external APIs
- No AI calls at runtime
- Uses UV for environment and dependency management
- Timeline: Single-phase implementation (Phase I only)
